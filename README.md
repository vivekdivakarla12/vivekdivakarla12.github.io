Our project involves the non-profit company FriendshipWorks, who work to match older adults to volunteers to make a lasting connection and lower rates of isolation. FriendshipWorks has multiple programs, but two they focus on are medical escort and friendly visiting. Medical Escort focuses on volunteers assisting older adults on their way to medical appointments, which can be a massive help as many adults don’t end up going to their doctor’s visits on their own. Their biggest program, Friendly Visiting, involves matching volunteers to older adults and spending time together approximately once a week. Building these connections are incredibly important for older adults, and some of the connections have lasted up to 40 years. Our purpose is to find the overlap between the elderly and the volunteers that work with Friendship Works. Finding overlaps in interests or backgrounds might lead to more compatibility between the two and higher satisfaction from taking part in Friendship Works.

The visualizations we are making are mainly for the organization members and volunteers to help them figure out what imbalances there are in their system. Based on the data they have, the organization wants to figure out if there are any major differences in the clusters between volunteers and older adults. We will be using zip code data to figure this out, and the type of consumption will be discovered and presented. After making these visualizations, the organization could use this to present in order to receive funding.
